//how to create a class and use inheritance
//some code in oop2 needs to be refactored
//let's create a single object and try to reuse it we cna use a class

// Example of a VERY simple Monopoly game simulation

let squares = [100, -10, 0, 0, -40, -10, -10, 5, 0, -10, -50, -10, 0, 0, -50, -10];

// Creation of the class
class Player {
  // The constructor is the method triggered with the `new` keyword
  //constructor takes two parameters
  constructor(name, color) {
    //this refers to the newly created object
    this.name = name;
    this.color = color;
    this.position = 0;
    this.cash = 1000;
  }

  // Method move
  move() {
    let dice = 1 + Math.floor(6 * Math.random());
    this.position = (this.position + dice) % squares.length;
    this.cash += squares[this.position];
    if (this.cash < 0) {
      console.log(`Game over for ${this.name}.`);
    }
  }

  // Method displayInfo
  displayInfo() {
    console.log(`${this.name} is at position ${this.position} and has ${this.cash}â‚¬`);
  }
}

// --- Initialization of players ---
//here i call the constructor pass the name of the class that i am creatign and the arguments 
let player1 = new Player('Joaquim', 'red');
let player2 = new Player('Maxence', 'blue');
let player3 = new Player('Mostafa', 'black');

// --- Turn 1  ---
player1.move();
player2.move();
player3.move();

// --- Turn 2  ---
player1.move();
player2.move();
player3.move();

player1.displayInfo();
player2.displayInfo();
player3.displayInfo();


//The constructor is a method which is used to create the instance objects.
